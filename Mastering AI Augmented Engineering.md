Here is a comprehensive 1-day (4-8 hour) training curriculum designed for professional developers. This course focuses on transitioning from "using AI as a chatbot" to "integrating AI agents into a systematic engineering workflow."

# Course Title: AI-Augmented Engineering: Mastering Agents & Context

**Instructor**: AI Programming Expert
**Duration**: 4-8 Hours (Modular)
**Target Audience**: Professional Software Engineers, Tech Leads
**Prerequisites**: Proficiency in git, coding (TypeScript/Python preferred), and VS Code.

-----

## Course Overview

This training moves beyond basic prompting. We focus on **Context Engineering**—the art of structuring your project so AI agents (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf) can act as autonomous senior engineers rather than junior assistants. The core philosophy is that **documentation is the interface for the AI**.

-----

## Module 1: The AI-First Development Environment (1 Hour)

### 1.1 The Agent Landscape

  * **Cursor**: Best for "in-the-flow" coding. Strengths: Inline editing (`Cmd+K`), Composer (multi-file edits), and `.cursorrules` for project-specific rules.
  * **Claude Code (Anthropic)**: Best for deep analysis, architectural planning, and documentation generation. Uses `CLAUDE.md` for context.
  * **Windsurf**: A hybrid cloud-native approach. Uses `.windsurf/` directory for context and offers deep cloud synchronization.

### 1.2 The "Context Document" Revolution

  * **The Problem**: Without context, AI agents hallucinate or generate generic code that doesn't fit your architecture.
  * **The Solution**: Context documents serve as "Project Memory," "Coding Principles," and a "Navigation Guide".
  * **Critical Rule**: If you don't document it, the agent can't know it.

### 1.3 Lab: Environment Setup

  * **Task**: Install your chosen agent (Cursor/Claude/Windsurf).
  * **Task**: Create the "Root Context File" (`.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md`) containing:
      * Project Overview
      * Tech Stack
      * Code Style/Patterns
  * *Instructor Note*: Emphasize keeping the main file under \~400 lines for optimal token usage.

## Module 2: Core Workflows (2 Hours)

### 2.1 Scenario A: Starting from Scratch

  * **Initialization**: Use the agent to scaffold the project structure.
      * *Prompt Pattern*: "Create a new [Stack] project with feature-based folder organization, TypeScript config, and a documentation directory.".
  * **The "Documentation First" Loop**:
    1.  **Plan**: Ask the agent to plan the feature.
    2.  **Generate**: Create the code structure.
    3.  **Document**: Immediately document the established pattern (e.g., "Data Fetching Pattern").

### 2.2 Scenario B: Migrating Existing Projects

  * **Analysis Phase**: Don't start coding yet. Ask the agent: "Analyze this codebase. What is the architecture? What patterns are used?".
  * **Strategies**:
      * **The Scout Rule**: Document patterns as you touch legacy code.
      * **Incremental Context**: Start with a basic `CLAUDE.md` and grow it as you explore.

### 2.3 Lab: The "First Feature"

  * **Task**: Implement a simple feature (e.g., a "User Profile" API).
  * **Constraint**: You must define a "Pattern" for error handling first, document it in `docs/patterns/ERROR_HANDLING.md`, and force the agent to use it.

## Module 3: Advanced Documentation Patterns (1.5 Hours)

### 3.1 The Three-Tier Hierarchy

We utilize a scalable documentation structure to prevent context overflow:

1.  **Tier 1: Main Context** (`CLAUDE.md`/`.cursorrules`): High-level rules, critical security info, and links.
2.  **Tier 2: Pattern Docs** (`docs/patterns/*.md`): The "Source of Truth" for how to solve specific problems (e.g., State Management, Testing).
3.  **Tier 3: Feature Docs** (`docs/features/*.md`): Specs for specific business logic.

### 3.2 Anatomy of a Pattern Document

A pattern document isn't just text; it's training data for the model. It must include:

  * **When to use**: Criteria for application.
  * **Code Examples**: Real-world snippets (not generic).
  * **Do's and Don'ts**: Specific constraints (e.g., "Don't use `any`", "Do use `zod` for validation").

### 3.3 Lab: Refactoring Documentation

  * **Task**: Take a generic piece of code generated by the AI.
  * **Action**: Identify why it's generic. Create a `docs/patterns/MY_PATTERN.md` file.
  * **Retry**: Ask the AI to regenerate the code "referencing `docs/patterns/MY_PATTERN.md`". Compare the results.

-----

## Module 4: Collaboration & Team Dynamics (1 Hour)

### 4.1 Git & Shared Context

  * **Rule**: Context documents (`.cursorrules`, `docs/`) must be committed to version control.
  * **Benefit**: Onboarding new team members (and their agents) becomes instantaneous.
  * **Workflow**: Updates to patterns require a PR. The "Context" is treated as code.

### 4.2 AI-Assisted Code Review

  * **Reviewing Agent Code**: Never trust; always verify.
  * **The Checklist**:
      * Does it follow the patterns in `docs/patterns/`?
      * Did the agent hallucinate a library import?
      * Is the business logic accurate?

-----

## Module 5: Troubleshooting & Best Practices (1 Hour)

### 5.1 Common Failure Modes

  * **Generic Code**: Usually caused by missing or vague context documents. **Fix**: Add specific examples to context.
  * **Buggy Code**: Caused by blind acceptance. **Fix**: Ask the agent to "Explain how this works" or "Write a test for this bug".
  * **Context Drift**: When code changes but docs don't. **Fix**: Make documentation updates part of the Definition of Done.

### 5.2 Prompt Engineering for Agents

  * **Bad**: "Create a form."
  * **Good**: "Create a form following our *React Hook Form + Zod pattern*. See `docs/patterns/FORM_HANDLING.md` for reference.".
